	<p style="line-height: 2em;font-size: 150%"><b>Overview</b>
	<br>Established in 1996 as Saikai of Miami, Inc. by Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila, Alienware assembles desktops, 
	<br>notebooks, workstations, and PC gaming consoles.According to employees, the name
	<br>"Alienware" was chosen because of the founders' fondness for the hit television series The X-Files, which
	<br>also inspired the science-fiction themed names of product lines such as Area-51, Hangar 18, and
	<br>Aurora.In 1997, it changed its name to Alienware.
